"My Cybersecurity Learning Journey" 

This is where I document my hands-on learning skills in offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) security.

This repository showcases my labs, projects, and progress as I build real-world cybersecurity skills.


Week 2 - Day 2 — Cybersecurity learning journey Cont’d
Networking Basics
Goal:
To learn and demonstrate the core principles of home network communication, including:
    • Network basics and common home-network terminology
    • Wireless standards and secure SSID configuration
    • Router setup and LAN/WAN interaction
    • Protocols and standards mapping (OSI vs TCP/IP)
What I did
    • Performed a theoretical review of network communication protocols and models.
    • Built and validated a full home network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer (router, laptop, PC, TV, internet/cloud).
    • Verified DHCP, routing, and wireless connectivity; confirmed inter-device communication with test pings.
Key learnings
    • Practical mapping of protocols to OSI/TCP-IP layers improves diagnostic clarity.
    • DHCP and NAT behavior on the router are central for home connectivity and security posture.
    • Wireless configuration (SSID, WPA2, passphrase) must balance usability and security.
    • Simulation-first approach reduces risk and speeds iterative learning.
Files
    • HomeNetwork.pkt — Packet Tracer simulation file (full topology and configs)
    • README.md — This summary + steps to reproduce the lab
    • docs/screenshots/ — Key screenshots and short step log
